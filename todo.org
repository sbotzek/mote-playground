* ICE draw animated tiles in tilemap
tiles with an animation have the following properties:
- length :: number of tiles in the animation
- delay :: optional, how long between frames, defaults to 100ms

* ICE use a sprite for player & animate them
* ICE draw player under certain tiles
* PAUSE experiment with using combined buffer(s) for drawing the tilemap
Initial trials seems to significantly reduce the amount of time spent in draw, but it would take more work to make it work properly.  Tilemap rendering isn't exactly a bottleneck either.
